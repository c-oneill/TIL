#### Show hidden files

Date: 01/19/2021

Mac OS X hides certain files that might be dangerous/destructive for a user to casually edit. This includes 'hidden' files that start with `.` (ie. `.git_ignore`), files like `etc/`. I've also noticed invisible files that start with `~$`.

These folders can be shown in Finder or on the Desktop with a shortcut:
```
command + shift + dot/period
```
Use the same command to toggle out and re-hide the files.
