#### Source

Date: 01/19/2021

```
source fileName [arguments]
```
Note: `.` = `source` (don't forget the whitespace!)
```
. fileName [arguments]
```

It's a built-in bash command that executes the content of the file passed. It does so *in the current shell*.

Note: not to be confused with `./script` --> this invokes `script` as an executable (another TIL)
